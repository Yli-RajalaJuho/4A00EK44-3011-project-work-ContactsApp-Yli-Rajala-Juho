Project: ContactsApp 

The project is a usable contacts application that can store and load all the information to and from a separate text file.
The application itself is a graphical user interface.
It holds five separate buttons for adding, searching, updating, deleting and clearing contacts.
A single contact is set so that it needs to have an id by the finnish standards, a firstname, a lastname, and a phonenumber.
A sigle contact can also have an address and an email address but these are not mandatory.

All the information that the application has depends on the text file as it refers to it constantly when saving the possible changes the end user makes.
It also refers to it when the application starts by loading the information from the text file into usable form by the application.
Any changes to the text file separately through files can cause some major bugs and may potentially crash the whole application.

The application is run with the command [cd src/ && javac *.java && java ContactsApp].
